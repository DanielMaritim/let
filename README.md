# let

a simple repo about the let keyword in JS and its significance

The main importance of the let keyword allows you to declare variables that are limited to a scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used

var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.

So what is this block that we talk of...?
Block Scope. A block scope is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block
